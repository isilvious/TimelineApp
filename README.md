TimelineApp
By: Isaac Silvious

An Android application called “Timeline” that allowed the user to save a message or status and attach the date and location to it. The user could then go back and view each message as well as see the location it was created through Google Maps

I currently don't have any plans to update the UI, but there's a lot of functionality here already.
